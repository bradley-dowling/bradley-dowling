# Welcome!

My name is Bradley Dowling! I'm currently a Junior at __Washington State University__ studying computer science (go cougs!). 
My portfolio here contains some of my course assignments and projects that I've worked on over the past couple of years.

I'm by no means a great coder, but I'm enthusiastic about programming and am getting better all the time!
